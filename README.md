This is a small http server based on vweb. It serves all the text in the 'posts' file

After compiling type `./http_demo --serve 8080` to start the server on port 8080 or `./http_demo --serve 8080 &` to run it in the background.
`./http_demo --add "<your message>"` adds what you type between the quoutes into the posts file.
